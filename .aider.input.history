+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: An alert service for large trades (“whale” orders) and abnormal volume.
+User goal: Catch moments when big players enter the market.
+Core features (MVP):
+
+* Real-time volume monitoring for several pairs.
+* Alert rules:
+
+Candle volume > X times the average.
+Single order > N $.
+
+
+* Notification delivery: Telegram bot or email.
+* History of recent “whale” events.
+
+Development plan:
+
+1. Connect to the exchange WebSocket API for streaming tickers/candles/trades.
+2. Implement a backend service that:
+
+aggregates volumes;
+compares them with a moving average;
+triggers events.
+
+
+3. Create a Telegram bot to deliver alerts.
+4. Build a minimal web interface for:
+
+setting thresholds,
+entering Telegram ID / email.
+
+
+5. Log events for history and simple charts.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
