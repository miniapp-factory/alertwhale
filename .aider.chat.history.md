```
Idea: An alert service for large trades (“whale” orders) and abnormal volume.
User goal: Catch moments when big players enter the market.
Core features (MVP):

* Real-time volume monitoring for several pairs.
* Alert rules:

Candle volume > X times the average.
Single order > N $.


* Notification delivery: Telegram bot or email.
* History of recent “whale” events.

Development plan:

1. Connect to the exchange WebSocket API for streaming tickers/candles/trades.
2. Implement a backend service that:

aggregates volumes;
compares them with a moving average;
triggers events.


3. Create a Telegram bot to deliver alerts.
4. Build a minimal web interface for:

setting thresholds,
entering Telegram ID / email.


5. Log events for history and simple charts.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized whale silhouette in deep blue against a gradient ocean background, with a glowing trade arrow pointing upward, symbolizing large trade alerts. The whale is rendered with smooth curves and a subtle ripple effect around its body, while the arrow is bright teal and has a faint glow to indicate real‑time activity. The overall composition conveys motion and alertness, suitable for a trading alert application.
